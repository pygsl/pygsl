	* gsl_function_typemaps.i had a memory leak. Thanks for Nor Pirzkal
	  for reporting this problem. Added the module callback function_test
	  helping in debugging the callback function helpers
	
	* interpolation / splines: changed the internal representation
	Now the memory managment is handled by python. Further the arrays are
	only converted once when the interpolation is used ...

	* fixed the order of variables for multifit.wlinear (not affected
	real code but was confusing to the user as the names did not
	match the meaning).

	* gsl_error_typemaps.i: Fixed check of return from PyGSL_ERROR_FLAG

	* rng: fixed the rng helper PyGSL_rng_uidA_to_uiA which handles the
	  rng method multinomial

        * I used to undefine GSL_ERROR macros as well as define
	  the GSL error function as a macro with 0 arguments to find
	  usage of gsl_error within the wrapper. 
	  This is uncommented as it created trouble within the code.

	* Fixed the tool exporting constant functions. The const module was 
	  updated to the constants of gsl version 1.13
	
2008-10-25    Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@sourceforge.net>
	* Changed the default error handling within PyGSL
	  Before I installed a gsl_error handler. This handler would then 
	  translate the error numbers to python exceptions. Now this handler
	  is switched off, as the above approach requires the GIL, which
	  numpy's ufunc dispose. 
	  Now the error object is set up by the called function before giving
	  control back to python. Unfortunately the description is lost this
	  way.
	  From now on all C code within pygsl must us pygsl_error and PyGSL_ERROR
	  and associated to get the translater function called.

	* Fixed memory leak in spline / interpolation due to freearg wrongly
	named argfree!
	
2008-02-18   Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@sourceforge.net>
	* Found out that I should consider Changelog more seriously
	* Changes according to my (lossy) mind
	   -- Fixed memory leak in rng
	   -- Moved odeiv.apply to odeiv.apply_vector
	   -- Readded Function (odeiv.apply)
	   -- Fixed memory leak in odeiv.apply_vector	  
	* Added support for numpy. On this way I found out, (as required
	  for 64bit architectures)
	   - converted all code to use pygsl_array_index_t 
	     (see Include/pygsl/block_helpers.h)
	  -  added internal methods PyGSL_vector_check and PyGSL_array_check.
	     These can now also handle arrays which have a non native stride.
	     In this case they will make a contiguous copy
	* Added testing.sf and testing.complex module. This now exports the 
	  relevant functions. These all are implemented as Numeric or numpy 
	  ufuncs. 
	* What did I do the last years? I do not remember ....
	
2005-06-01  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed an off by one error in the siman module
	
2005-04-04  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@sourceforge.net>
	* input1 was used as second input in functions
	  PyGSL_statistics_d_AA, PyGSL_statistics_d_AAd, PyGSL_statistics_d_AAdd
 	   Fixed.	
	* removed a tangling goto in PyGSL_statistics_d_AA

2005-1-22  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	   * Changed the build process. Will read the last selection
	   for numarray/Numeric if already made. If not, looks which
	   one it can import, and this it will use. Preference is 
	   Numeric. You can make a selection on the command line using
	   --array-object=Numeric|numarray.

2005-1     Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	   * Added switchable debug prints for the C modules
	     Compile the software with debug=1. Then you can 
	     use pygsl.init.set_debug_level() to switch the 
             debug prints off and on
	
2004-12    Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	   * Added fft module
	   
	
2004-04    Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	   * Added support for numarray. Now numarray
	     can be defined at compile time and numarray
	     conversion routines are used internally.

           Eric Gurrola, Peter Stoltz
	* Moved common functions to one python module to support the 
	  MAC OSX platform
	* Rewrite of the statistics module. Moved common functions to 
	  one module. Made them generic and changed the macros to use these
	  generic functions.
	
2004-01-09 Leonardo Milano
	* Added support for rpm generation
	
2003-12-27  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
        * Reimplementation of the siman module
	
2003-12-22  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added Monte Carlo support    
	
2003-12-17 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* error return codes are translated to python exceptions internally.
	  This changed the API for many functions
	  
2003-12-16 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
        * Reimplementation of the rng module supporting internal sampling.
           moved to main tree

2003-12-11 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Clean up of the diff module:
	  -- Added checks of the return values of the python callback
	  -- Simplified the code
	  -- Thread safety
	   
2003-05-25 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added build support for platforms without a shell
	
2003-10-5   Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added translation of the GSL error number code into the approbriate
	  python exception.

2003-06-03 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
        * combined all helper functions in a library.
	* added support for Monte Carlo Integration and Combination. 
	* added methods to the permutation. Moved the tolist method to a C 
	  implementation.
	* Fixed a bug in the error reporting of the float conversion routine.
	* added Hankel transform support
	* Fixed the spline implementation (was using the interpolation 
	  implementation instead of the spline implementation)
	
2003-05-18  Achim Gädke  <achim.gaedke@physik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* now checked in several changes to create a new release.
	  activated all available modules, updated README.html

2003-02-09 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	
        * src/poly, src/callback, src/gslwrap : added these directories, which
 	  provide low level wrapper interface files for swig. These provide low
	  level interfaces for polynomial, blas, eigen, linalg, integration, 
	  root finding, minimization, multi roots finding, chebychev series
	  multi dimensional non linear fit
	
	* pygsl/blas.py, pygsl/eigen.py pygsl/linalg.py 
	  These wrappers were written by Fabian Jakobs.

	* pygsl/
	
	* Makefile : added. It is only used for developing the swig wrappers.

2003-03-07  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@jochen-kuepper.de>

	* gsl_Extension.py (gsl_Extension.get_gsl_version): Remove final '+'
	from version string. This is used by GSL for cvs versions, these are
	now treated analogous to the previous release.


2002-01-27  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@jochen-kuepper.de>

	* gsl_Extension.py (gsl_Extension.__init__): Set additional macro
	NUMERIC to 0 or 1 according to the availablity of NumPy. This
	macro can be used as boolean flag in code.


	* Local Variables:
	* mode: auto-fill
	* fill-column: 79
	* End:
